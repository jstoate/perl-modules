# Perl Modules 
A compilation of small Perl modules to help accomplish tasks in Perl.

I've tried my best to comment code as much as possible to help you understand what the different arguments etc does. The module names should be quite descriptive so you know what the module does (for example, INIReader.pm reads INI files).

Hopefully you find these modules useful. Feel free to use them and modify them as you want.
